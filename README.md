# Approaches To Styling
Example code for styling web apps at multiple skill levels. Examples include CSS
frameworks, pre-processors, and postCSS.

## Getting Started

This repository contains three project folders, each containing an approach to
styling. To open a project in your browser, install its package dependencies and
and run the start script. For example:

```
cd 01-for-beginners/
npm install
npm start
```

Now open your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
